# n.b. - The '~/var' directory needs to exist before these script will work properly.
#        I'd have put something like 'mkdir -p ~/var' in m(), but I didn't want the
#        extra call to mkdir everytime m() was called.
#

# Mark a directory (ie, set the directory)
function m()   { pwd > ~/var/mdir${1}; }

# Go to a directory
function g()   { cd `cat ~/var/mdir${1}`; }

# Print the directory.  Useful for embedding in scripts. eg: "cp `p somedir`/file.ext ."
function p()   { cat ~/var/mdir${1}; }

# Delete the mark
function d()   { rm -f ~/var/mdir${1}; }

# Prints the list of all marks.
# The usage of 'k' is historical.  It used to be called 'mlk' for 'm' and 'look'.  Then
# I shortened it to one letter.  Since I don't like the idea of using 'l', I chose 'k'.
function k()   { grep . ~/var/mdir* |  sed "s/:/       /"; }
